## Introduction

`reveal-me` is a powerful command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to enhance the experience of creating, managing, and presenting slideshows with [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/). It simplifies the workflow for users by offering features such as live reloading, presentation serving, and more, directly from the command line.

## Installation

To get started with `reveal-me`, you must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed on your machine. Once [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) is set up, you can install `reveal-me` globally using npm with admin privileges (e.g. use `sudo` on Linux or macOS, or run the command prompt as an administrator on Windows).

```bash
npm install -g reveal-me
```

This makes the `reveal-me` command available globally.

## Project Initialization (Optional)

To create a new project with `reveal-me`, first navigate to the directory where you want to create the project.

```bash
mkdir /path/to/my-project
cd /path/to/my-project
```

Then, run the `reveal-me` command with the `-i` or `--init` option to create a new project. It will prompt you to enter configuration details for the project, such as the project name, description, and other settings.

```bash
reveal-me --init
```

This will generate a new project with a default configuration file and directory structure. You can then add your presentations to the project and customize the configuration as needed.

```bash
# /path/to/my-project

â””â”€â”€ my-project/
    â”œâ”€â”€ assets/                 # Assets directory for images, scripts, and styles
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/             # Use "@/images/..." in your slides to reference items in this directory
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ partials/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ favicon.ico
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ favicon-16x16.png
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ favicon-32x32.png
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ preprocessor.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ src/                    # Source directory for presentations content
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ hello-world.md
    â”œâ”€â”€ config.json
    â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
    â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

Now you can start creating presentations in the `src` directory and use the `reveal-me` command to serve or build them.

```bash
reveal-me . --watch
```

## CLI Usage

## Configuration

`reveal-me` can be configured using a JSON file. By default, `reveal-me` looks for a file named `config.json` in the root directory of your project. You can also specify a different configuration file using the `-c` or `--config` option. This allows you to customize various aspects of your presentations, including the server's host and port, directories for assets and output, and paths for custom templates and styles.

## Presentation Management

### Creating Presentations

To create a new presentation, organize your content and assets into a directory structure. You can use Markdown or HTML for your slides, and include any necessary CSS or JavaScript files in the specified assets directory.

### Building Presentations

Use the `-b` or `--build` option to compile your presentation into static files. This is useful for deploying your presentation to a web server or hosting service.

### Serving Presentations

To serve a presentation locally, simply run `reveal-me` with the path to your presentation directory. Use the `--host` and `--port` options to specify the server configuration, and `--no-open` if you do not want the presentation to automatically open in your browser.

## Advanced Features

### Live Reloading

Enable live reloading with the `-w` or `--watch` option. This automatically refreshes your presentation in the browser when you make changes to the slides or assets.

### Printing to PDF

`reveal-me` supports printing presentations to PDF. Use the `-p` or `--print` option, followed optionally by the filename for the PDF. Customize the print size with `--print-size`.

### Custom Templates and Themes

Customize your presentation with custom templates and themes by specifying paths to your HTML template, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files using the respective options.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while using `reveal-me`, verify your configuration and command-line options. Ensure that all paths are correct and that you have the necessary permissions to read from and write to the specified directories.
